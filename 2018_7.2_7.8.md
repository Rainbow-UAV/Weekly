# Cesim 1.47
## 坐标系更新


##### Breaking Changes :mega:* glTF 2.0 models corrected to face +Z forwards per specification.  Internally Cesium uses +X as forward, so a new +Z to +X rotation was added for 2.0 models only. To fix models that are oriented incorrectly after this change:    * If the model faces +X forwards update the glTF to face +Z forwards. This can be done by loading the glTF in a model editor and applying a 90 degree clockwise rotation about the up-axis. Alternatively, add a new root node to the glTF node hierarchy whose `matrix` is `[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]`.    * Apply a -90 degree rotation to the model's heading. This can be done by setting the model's `orientation` using the Entity API or from within CZML. See [#6738](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/6738) for more details.

修正

```
   var headingTemp = aircraft.yawangle + 90;    if (headingTemp > 360) headingTemp -= 360    var heading = Cesium.Math.toRadians(headingTemp);
```
